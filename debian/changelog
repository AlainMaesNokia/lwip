lwip (2.1.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Joan Lled贸 ]
  * debian/patches/patch9350:
    * Remove _HAVE_SA_LEN macros
      * Some macros related to sa_len field were written to this
        file by mistake
  * debian/patches/port:
    * Fix bug on thrad handling
      * In the Hurd, pthread_cond_timedwait() returns EINTR when
        the thread has been cancelled
    * Move some #includes in cc.h from max_sockets to port:
      * <sys/ioctl.h>
      * <fcntl.h>
      * <net/if.h>
      * <sys/types.h>
    * Fix build error on some architectures
      * sio module: memset struct sigaction to 0
        * Use memset to set all struct sigaction fields to 0
          instead of doing it field by field, since fields depend
          on the architecture
  * debian/patches/max_sockets:
    * Remove #includes in cc.h moved to port patch
